	<p>The benefit of this is you don’t have to think about it as much. If you want to remove a border from an element, set border: initial. If you want to restore an element to its default width, set width: initial.

		You may be in the habit of using the value auto to do this sort of reset. In fact, you can use width: auto to achieve the same result. This is because the default value of width is auto.

		It’s important to note, however, that auto isn’t the default value for all properties. It’s not even valid for many properties; for example, border-width: auto and padding: auto are invalid and therefore have no effect. You could take the time to dig up the initial value for these, but it’s often easier to use initial. </p>
